# Modified-Apriori-Association-Rule-Generation
In this project I attempted to generate association rules using modified apriori algorithm.
An apriori alorithm is implemented in python from scratch to generate 4-frequent itemsets, and association rules using frequent itemsets. 'Support' and 'Confidence' are taken as metrics.
Data: The text file consist of list purchased items. Each unique 8 character id represents unique item and each row represents one unique transaction.
